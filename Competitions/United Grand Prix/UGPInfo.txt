## Entry ##
- Anyone can play the qualification freely! You may continue the cup if you qualified, learn more below!

## Format ##
- The cup has two phases, the Qualifiers & Finals

### Qualifiers ###
- Qualifiers are the first phase of the cup. They can be played by anyone regardless of skill.
- We will only use Dedimania records for qualification which means that playing the tracks offline will not count towards qualification. 
- Only records from the qualification server will be accepted.

### Finals ###
- The finals will be held in two separate days with different environments on each day;
-- Semi-final (Three environments, 60 laps total)
-- Grand final (Four environments, 80 laps total)

## Prizes ##
- The grand prize will for now be a bronze tag (=1000cc). We can slowly upgrade the tag by raising the prize pool but that relies on our community! 
- If we reach 3000cc we will upgrade the tag to a silver one and when we reach 10000cc we will upgrade to a gold tag! 
- If we exceed 10000cc, the other coppers will be split and given to the 2nd and 3rd place of the UGP. 
- 10% of the donations are kept.
- We will give out special Discord roles for the best achievements in the cup! Make sure to hunt it all and have a shot at getting the secret rewards.
